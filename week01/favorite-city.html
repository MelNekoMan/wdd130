    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Japan is the place that inspires me most in the world.
        Although I have never lived there (honestly, it is one of my dreams to live there), I feel a deep connection
        with its culture and way of life.
        I am fascinated by how this country achieves a perfect balance between the traditional and the modern: ancient
        temples surrounded by cherry blossoms coexist with high-speed trains and futuristic cities like Tokyo.
        As a lover of programming, I am particularly drawn to Japan because it is a global leader in technological
        innovation, but beyond that, I love its art, its cuisine, its language, and its culture.
        Japan is not just a country I like, it is a place that inspires me to be better, to learn more, and to dream
        big.</p>
