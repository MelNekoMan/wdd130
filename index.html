    <p>Hello, my name is Melvin Alvarez. I live in Caracas, Venezuela, a vibrant city that has seen me grow and dream.
      From a young age, I discovered that my true passion is programming, as I have always loved computers.
      I love how, through code, I can solve problems, create useful things, and express my creativity.
      Studying what I am passionate about fills me with joy and motivation.
      Every day I learn something new, and that drives me to continue growing and giving my best on this path I have chosen.
      And, for the first time, I can say that studying makes me happy.</p>
